TODO
====

* ☐ Add a logging of sessions.

* ☐ Use setup.cfg

* ☐ Configuration
  * Use sqlite database? This is done in Android programs. Needs a
    get, set, import, and export commands.
  * Use JSON?
  * Use ConfigParser?
  * Simple module import?

* ☑ Return to Trio.
  * Why bother with arithmical edge cases when you can just tell Trio
    what to do?
